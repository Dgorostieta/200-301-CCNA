FULL/ -: The neighbor state is full, with the “-“ instead of letters meaning that the link
does not use a DR/BDR.
FULL/DR: The neighbor state is full, and the neighbor is the DR.
FULL/BDR: The neighbor state is full, and the neighbor is the backup DR (BDR).
FULL/DROTHER: The neighbor state is full, and the neighbor is neither the DR nor BDR.
(It also implies that the local router is a DR or BDR because the state is FULL.)
2WAY/DROTHER: The neighbor state is 2-way, and the neighbor is neither the DR nor
BDR—that is, a DROther router. (It also implies that the local router is also a DROther
router because otherwise the state would reach a full state.)
