            Implementing Single-Area OSPFv2

Step 1. Use the router ospf process-id global command to enter OSPF configuration
mode for a particular OSPF process.
Step 2. (Optional) Configure the OSPF router ID by doing the following:
A. Use the router-id id-value router subcommand to define the router ID, or
B. Use the interface loopback number global command, along with an ip
address address mask command, to configure an IP address on a loopback
interface (chooses the highest IP address of all working loopbacks), or
C. Rely on an interface IP address (chooses the highest IP address of all working
nonloopbacks).
Step 3. Use one or more network ip-address wildcard-mask area area-id router
subcommands to enable OSPFv2 on any interfaces matched by the configured
address and mask, enabling OSPF on the interface for the listed area.




            OSPF Interface Configuration Example
Step 1. Use the no network network-id area area-id subcommands in OSPF configuration
mode to remove the network commands.
Step 2. Add one ip ospf process-id area area-id command in interface configuration
mode under each interface on which OSPF should operate, with the correct
OSPF process (process-id) and the correct OSPF area number.

FULL/ -: The neighbor state is full, with the “-“ instead of letters meaning that the link
does not use a DR/BDR.
FULL/DR: The neighbor state is full, and the neighbor is the DR.
FULL/BDR: The neighbor state is full, and the neighbor is the backup DR (BDR).
FULL/DROTHER: The neighbor state is full, and the neighbor is neither the DR nor BDR.
(It also implies that the local router is a DR or BDR because the state is FULL.)
2WAY/DROTHER: The neighbor state is 2-way, and the neighbor is neither the DR nor
BDR—that is, a DROther router. (It also implies that the local router is also a DROther
router because otherwise the state would reach a full state.)

■ Passive interfaces
■ Default routes
■ Metrics
■ Load balancing


            Setting the Cost Based on Interface and Reference Bandwidth
            
1. Set the cost explicitly, using the ip ospf cost x interface subcommand, to a value
between 1 and 65,535, inclusive.
2. Although it should be avoided, change the interface bandwidth with the bandwidth
speed command, with speed being a number in kilobits per second (Kbps).
3. Change the reference bandwidth, using router OSPF subcommand auto-cost
reference-bandwidth ref-bw, with a unit of megabits per second (Mbps).

RIDs must be unique.                                        show ip ospf
They must pass any neighbor authentication.                 show ip ospf interface
